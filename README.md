# DnnC MDesign 
## Description

A free open source responsive skin\theme for Dnn (DotNetNuke) using Bootstrap3 & Material Design for Bootstrap.

A demo of the theme/skin can be viewed by visiting [http://www.dnnmdesign.com](http://www.dnnmdesign.com "Official DnnMDesign site")

## Warning : Install on Dnn 08.00.00
There is a small bug in this version of Dnn that will stop the menu showing.
To solve this is quite easy to do by following theses steps below:

Go to '/Portals/' folder of your Dnn install
In this folder you will find a file called 'web.config'
Open this file and search for the following 3 lines of html

`<host factoryType="System.Web.Mvc.MvcWebRazorHostFactory, System.Web.Mvc"/>`

`<add namespace="DotNetNuke.Web.Mvc.Helpers"/>`
`<add namespace="Dnn.Modules.DynamicContentViewer.Helpers"/>`

Change the lines above to this:

`<!--<host factoryType="System.Web.Mvc.MvcWebRazorHostFactory, System.Web.Mvc"/>-->`

`<!--<add namespace="DotNetNuke.Web.Mvc.Helpers"/>-->`
`<!--<add namespace="Dnn.Modules.DynamicContentViewer.Helpers"/>-->`

Save the file and the menu's should display correctly.

## Theme Requirements & installation
Install the skin as you would with any other Dnn extension by going to the Host > Extensions page (you should not install via Admin/Extensions).
The Dnn MDesign them was created for Dnn8 and upwards.

To install follow the steps below:

1. Download and un-block the zip file from here.
2. Go to Host –> Extensions –> Install Extension wizard to install the MDesign skin pack.
3. After the installation has been completed, navigate to Admin –> Site Settings –> Basic Settings (tab) –> Appearance (section) and specify portal and edit skins and containers.

Enjoy!
